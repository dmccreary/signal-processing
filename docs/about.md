# About the Signal Processing Website

![](img/wordcloud.png)

This website is designed to help both instructors and students
who are interested in learning about signal processing.  This
website uses generative AI and encourages both instructors
and students to use generative AI to create and modify
content such as simulations and animations of signal processing
concepts.

We have used AI to generate a list of core concepts in
signal processing.
