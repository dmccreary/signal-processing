# About the Signal Processing Website

![](img/wordcloud.png)

This website is designed as a proof of concept site to help both instructors and students who are interested in learning about how AI can be used to teach signal processing.  This
website uses generative AI to create content around a learning graph and encourages both instructors
and students to use generative AI to create and modify
content such as simulations and animations of signal processing
concepts.

We have used the following workflow to generate much of this website.
