# About the Signal Processing with AI Website

![](img/wordcloud.png)

This website is designed as a proof-of-concept site to help both instructors and students who are interested in learning about how AI can be used to teach signal processing.  

!!! Warning
    This is not a complete course on signal processing.  It is a course
    that helps instructors and students learn how to use generative AI
    tools to create content in a signal processing course.

This
website uses generative AI to create content around a learning graph and encourages both instructors
and students to use generative AI to create and modify
content such as simulations and animations of signal processing
concepts.

We have used the following workflow to generate much of this website.
