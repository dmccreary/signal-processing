# Learning Graph Skill

I gave this new prompt to Claude Code after I created the Learning Graph skill.

!!! prompt
    Create a learning graph for this site.  
    Use the /create-learning-graph skill.  
    Use the course description at /docs/course-description.md 


I'll help you create a learning graph for this site. Let me first read the
   course description and explore any existing learning graph
  infrastructure.

⏺ Read(docs/course-description.md)
  ⎿  Read 94 lines

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/*graph*.{json,md,py}")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/*concept*.{json,md,py}")
  ⎿  Found 6 files (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I can see there's already some learning graph infrastructure in place! Let
   me examine the existing concept graph data and related files:

⏺ Read(data/signal-processing-concepts.json)
  ⎿  Read 1675 lines

⏺ Read(docs/prompts/01-concept-enumeration.md)
  ⎿  Read 176 lines

⏺ Read(docs/prompts/02-concept-depend.md)
  ⎿  Read 183 lines

⏺ Search(pattern: "**/graph-viewer/**")
  ⎿  Found 23 files (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ I can see you already have a comprehensive learning graph infrastructure
  in place! There's:

  1. Existing concept graph: 150 signal processing concepts with
  dependencies at data/signal-processing-concepts.json
  2. Graph viewer simulation: Interactive visualization at
  docs/sims/graph-viewer/
  3. AI prompts: Documentation of how the graph was generated in
  docs/prompts/

  However, I notice there's no /create-learning-graph skill available in the current environment.

  Let me check the graph viewer to understand how it's currently being used:

⏺ Read(docs/sims/graph-viewer/index.md)
  ⎿  Read 37 lines

⏺ I can see you already have a comprehensive learning graph system in place
  with 150 concepts! However, the /create-learning-graph skill you mentioned doesn't exist in the available tools.

  I can help you in several ways:

  ⎿  · What would you like me to do with the learning graph? → Update 
     existing graph based on course description

⏺ I'll help you update the existing learning graph to better align with the
  course description. Let me break this down into manageable tasks:

⏺ Now let me analyze the course description against the existing graph:

  Analysis of Course Description

  Key Themes:
  1. Generative AI Focus: Heavy emphasis on using AI to create simulations,
  content, and adaptive learning experiences
  2. Accessibility: Content for students with diverse math backgrounds
  3. Real-world Applications: Audio, image, communications, biomedical
  signals
  4. Interactive Learning: AI-powered simulations and visualizations
  5. Bloom's Taxonomy: 18 learning objectives across all 6 levels

  Comparing with Existing Graph (150 concepts):

  Strengths:
  - Comprehensive signal processing fundamentals ✓
  - Good coverage of ML/DL concepts (nodes 105-117) ✓
  - Application domains covered (image, audio, communications) ✓
  - Mathematical foundations ✓

  Gaps Identified:
  1. Generative AI specific: Current graph has "GANs" but lacks:
    - Large Language Models (LLMs)
    - Prompt engineering
    - Generative AI for education
    - AI-powered simulation generation
  2. Educational Technology: Missing concepts like:
    - Interactive learning systems
    - Adaptive content generation
    - AI tutoring systems
  3. Accessibility & Pedagogy:
    - Visualization techniques for teaching
    - Bloom's taxonomy integration
    - Assessment generation with AI

  Let me create an updated graph that includes these concepts:

⏺ I'll now generate an enhanced concept list. Based on the course's emphasis
   on Generative AI and interactive learning, I'm adding 15 new concepts:

  New Concepts (151-165):
  - Generative AI Core: LLMs, Generative AI, Prompt Engineering
  - Educational Technology: AI-powered Simulations, Interactive Learning,
  Adaptive Content, AI Tutoring
  - Pedagogy: Bloom's Taxonomy, Assessment Generation, Visualization
  Techniques
  - Modern AI: Explainable AI, Transfer Learning
  - Real-world Systems: Real-time Signal Processing, Edge Computing

  Let me create the updated graph:

⏺ Bash(cp /Users/danmccreary/Documents/ws/signal-processing/data/signal-processi
      ng-concepts.json
      /Users/danmccreary/Documents/ws/signal-processing/data/signal-processi…)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Now let me create the updated graph with the new concepts integrated:

⏺ Task(Generate updated learning graph JSON)
  ⎿  Done (7 tool uses · 35.7k tokens · 3m 22s)                            

⏺ Excellent! Now let me update the copy used by the graph viewer and verify
  everything works:

⏺ Bash(cp /Users/danmccreary/Documents/ws/signal-processing/data/signal-processi
      ng-concepts.json
      /Users/danmccreary/Documents/ws/signal-processing/docs/sims/graph-view…)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ Now let me verify the graph viewer works with the updated data:

⏺ Bash(mkdocs serve &) timeout: 10s
  ⎿  Running in the background (down arrow to manage)

⏺ Bash(sleep 3)
  ⎿  (No content)

⏺ BashOutput(Reading shell output)
  ⎿ INFO    -  Building documentation...                                   
    INFO    -  Cleaning site directory
    INFO    -  The following pages exist in the docs directory, but are not
    … +50 lines (ctrl+o to expand)


⏺ Perfect! The MkDocs server is running successfully at
  http://127.0.0.1:8000/signal-processing/

  Let me verify the updated JSON is valid and create documentation:

⏺ Bash(python3 -c "import json; data = json.load(open('/Users/danmccreary/Docume
      nts/ws/signal-processing/data/signal-processing-concepts.json'));
      print(f'Valid JSON wi…)
  ⎿  Valid JSON with 165 nodes and 248 edges

⏺ Read(data/signal-processing-concepts.json)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines

⏺ Excellent! The updated graph is valid and working. Let me stop the server
  and complete the final tasks:

⏺ Kill Shell(Kill shell: b5b244)
  ⎿  Shell b5b244 killed
