# Glossary of Terms

## Prompt

```linenums="0"
Create a glossary of terms for a class on signal processing.
Some terms will also have an abbreviation.
The definitions should be precise, concise, distinct and non-circular.
Return the results in a single raw markdown file
in alphabetical order.
The term name is in level 4 markdown heading.
For each term use the following format:

#### Term (Abbreviation)

Text of the definition of the term.

**Example:** Example of use of the term in the course.

### Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)

An efficient algorithm that computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and its inverse, reducing the computational complexity. This transformation decomposes a time-domain signal into its constituent frequencies, enabling rapid analysis and processing of frequency components.

**Example:** We use the FFT to analyze audio signals by converting a time-domain recording into its frequency spectrum. This allows them to identify dominant frequencies, filter out noise, and visualize the signal's frequency content for applications such as music analysis or noise reduction.
