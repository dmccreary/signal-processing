# Generating High Quality Citations

!!! prompt
    I would like to create a citation graph for the all the papers that reference the use of FFTs in modern microcontrollers.  Please do the following:

    Find the top 50 papers in peer reviewed journals that reference the use of FFTs in modern microcontrollers.  For each of these 50 papers, get the other papers that they cite.  

    For the entire list of papers, remove any papers that were only cited once.

    For each of the remaining papers, put their data in a JSON file with one node per paper and links for citations using the vis.js graph format.  Then create a vis.js program that views the citation graph for these papers.

## Thought Process

This is a research task involving finding academic papers and creating a visualization. Let me break this down:

Find the top 50 papers in peer-reviewed journals that reference the use of FFTs in modern microcontrollers
For each of these 50 papers, get the other papers they cite
Remove papers that were only cited once
Create a JSON file with node/link data in vis.js format
Create a vis.js program to visualize the citation graph

I'll need to use web search to find academic papers, as this requires current information beyond my knowledge cutoff. I should search for academic papers using scholarly databases or search engines.
Let me start by searching for papers about FFTs in microcontrollers.

## Sample Text

Effective citation practices begin with thorough literature searches that go beyond simple keyword matching. Use multiple academic databases, including IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Google Scholar, and discipline-specific repositories. Each database has different coverage patterns and indexing approaches, so comprehensive searches require multiple sources.

Develop systematic search strategies using Boolean operators and field-specific terminology. Signal processing spans multiple disciplines, so search terms should include variations like "digital signal processing," "statistical signal processing," "adaptive signal processing," and application-specific terms like "biomedical signal analysis" or "communications signal processing."

Trace citation networks both forward and backward in time. Start with seminal papers in your area and examine both their reference lists (backward citation) and papers that cite them (forward citation). This approach reveals important papers that might not appear in keyword searches and helps identify the most influential work in specific subfields.

### Evaluating Source Quality and Relevance

Develop systematic criteria for evaluating source quality that go beyond simple impact factor metrics. Consider the reputation of the publication venue, the rigor of the peer review process, and the relevance to your specific application domain. IEEE Transactions journals generally maintain higher standards than conference proceedings, which in turn are typically more rigorous than workshop papers.

Assess author credentials and institutional affiliations carefully. Established researchers at reputable institutions typically produce more reliable work, but don't dismiss contributions from newer researchers or industry practitioners who might offer fresh perspectives or practical insights.

Evaluate the recency and continued relevance of sources. Signal processing evolves rapidly, particularly in areas involving machine learning and artificial intelligence. While foundational mathematical concepts remain stable, implementation techniques and performance benchmarks change frequently.

### Primary vs Secondary Source Identification

Distinguish carefully between primary sources that report original research and secondary sources that summarize or interpret existing work. For fundamental algorithms and theoretical concepts, always cite the original papers where possible. This provides proper attribution and allows readers to access the complete technical details and assumptions.

Trace concepts back to their origins when possible. Many signal processing techniques have been rediscovered or reformulated multiple times. Citing the earliest clear formulation provides historical context and often reveals insights that later presentations might obscure.

Use review papers and survey articles strategically as starting points for literature searches, but avoid over-relying on them for technical details. These sources excel at providing broad overviews and identifying key papers but may not capture the nuances crucial for implementation or theoretical understanding.

### Technical Accuracy in Citations

Verify that citations accurately represent the content they're meant to support. This requires actually reading the cited papers rather than relying on abstracts or other authors' interpretations. Mismatched citations undermine credibility and can propagate errors through the literature.

Pay careful attention to the specific technical details when citing algorithmic papers. Ensure that parameter settings, assumptions, and performance metrics in your work align with those in the cited sources. Small differences in implementation details can lead to significantly different results.

Document any modifications or adaptations of cited techniques clearly. If you're using a variation of a published algorithm, explain the differences explicitly and cite both the original work and any intermediate sources that influenced your modifications.

### Citation Format and Style Consistency

Adopt a consistent citation style appropriate for your target audience and publication venue. IEEE style is standard for most signal processing publications, but other venues might require different formats. Consistency in formatting reflects attention to detail and professionalism.

Include sufficient bibliographic information for readers to locate sources easily. For conference papers, include the full conference name, location, and date. For journal articles, include volume numbers, issue numbers, and page ranges. For online sources, include access dates and DOI numbers when available.

Verify citation accuracy through multiple channels. Use reference management software to reduce formatting errors, but always double-check critical details manually. Many citation databases contain errors, and automated systems can propagate these mistakes.

### Balancing Citation Comprehensiveness and Relevance

Strike an appropriate balance between comprehensive coverage and focused relevance. Extensive citation lists can demonstrate scholarship but may overwhelm readers if not well-organized. Focus on the most relevant and influential sources while acknowledging the broader literature appropriately.

Organize citations thematically when dealing with complex topics that draw from multiple research areas. Group references by subtopic or methodological approach to help readers navigate the literature more effectively.

Consider your audience when determining citation depth. Academic papers typically require more extensive citations than technical reports or industrial documentation. Educational materials might benefit from fewer but more carefully selected references that guide further learning.

### Staying Current with Evolving Literature

Develop systematic approaches for monitoring new publications in your areas of interest. Set up automated alerts through academic databases, follow key researchers and institutions on academic social networks, and subscribe to relevant mailing lists and newsletters.

Regularly update reference lists for ongoing projects as new relevant work appears. This is particularly important for rapidly evolving areas like machine learning applications in signal processing, where significant advances occur frequently.

Maintain awareness of retracted papers and corrected publications. Scientific literature occasionally contains errors that are discovered and corrected after publication. Staying informed about these corrections helps maintain the accuracy of your own work.

### Documentation and Attribution Best Practices

Maintain detailed records of where you encountered each source and why you judged it relevant. This documentation helps during the writing process and enables you to respond effectively to reviewer questions about citation choices.

Acknowledge different types of contributions appropriately. Distinguish between sources that provide fundamental theoretical insights, practical implementation details, empirical validation, or historical context. Each type of contribution deserves recognition but might be acknowledged differently.

Consider the broader impact of your citation practices on the research community. Thoughtful citations help establish and maintain the intellectual lineage of ideas while giving appropriate credit to original contributors. This practice supports the collaborative nature of scientific progress and encourages continued innovation.

Balance citation of established authorities with recognition of newer contributors to avoid perpetuating citation bias. The signal processing community benefits from diverse perspectives and fresh approaches, which require active effort to discover and acknowledge appropriately.
