## Algorithm of the Century: Cooley and Tukey's FFT Revolution
![](./fft/cover.png) { width="400px"}
This tells the story of how James Cooley and John Tukey revolutionized signal processing by developing the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm in 1965 during the Cold War. Born from the practical need to detect Soviet nuclear tests, their breakthrough reduced calculation time from N² to N log N operations, making previously impossible computations feasible on 1960s computers. The algorithm spread rapidly across scientific disciplines after being published, enabling real-time signal analysis for applications ranging from seismology to astronomy. The FFT ultimately transformed entire industries—creating the foundation for digital signal processing, enabling technologies like MRI machines, digital audio, telecommunications, and countless other innovations that shape our modern digital world. Their story illustrates how elegant mathematical solutions to efficiency problems can have far greater impact than raw computing power alone.
