## Panel 1: "A Sky Full of Fear"

The story begins in 1934, with newspaper headlines screaming about Nazi rearmament. A fearful public and unprepared military contrast with the confident stride of a determined engineer—Robert Watson-Watt—walking into the British Air Ministry.

## Panel 2: "The 'Death Ray' Proposal"

Narrative:
British officials are searching for fantastical weapons. Watson-Watt is summoned to evaluate the feasibility of a "death ray." He calmly responds: “No ray, but perhaps... a wave.”

## Panel 3: "The Spark of Signal Processing"

Narrative:
Watson-Watt returns to his lab, pondering: “If we bounce radio waves off aircraft… we can detect them. But how do we process the signal from all that noise?”
