## MicroSims Course Description

**Title:** Creating and Customizing MicroSims

This 10-week course empowers both teachers and students to leverage generative AI for creating small interactive simulations, known as MicroSims, designed to simplify the understanding of complex topics.

While the course introduces a variety of interactive libraries, it emphasizes the use of Processing and p5.js as key development tools.

Participants will learn how to craft precise AI prompts that, when paired with carefully designed templates, result in high-quality, user-friendly MicroSims with consistent interfaces.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, participants will:

1.  Understand what MicroSims are and how they enhance classroom learning.
2.  Observe how Generative AI tools can create and modify MicroSims.
3.  Utilize p5.js development tools to build, test, and refine MicroSims.
4.  Develop skills in writing clear prompts that yield accurate AI-generated results.
5.  Experience how pre-defined p5.js templates ensure consistency and reproducibility in MicroSim creation.
6.  Gain practical experience providing feedback to generative AI to correct errors.
7.  Learn the foundational concepts of p5.js, including the setup and draw functions.
8.  Understand how to publish and share MicroSims using GitHub, including free hosting via GitHub Pages.
9.  Explore advanced p5.js features such as animation, complex drawing, function libraries, and sound integration.

## Prerequisites

Participants must have access to a computer with a keyboard. A mobile device or tablet without command-line access will not be sufficient for the course activities.
