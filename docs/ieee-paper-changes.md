# IEEE Signal Processing Paper Changes

1. Update to reflect the shift from single-prompt LLMs to reasoning models that generate a plan before the return the result
2. Update to reflect the movement from static single-pass use of LLMs to the use of agentic-powered IDE such as Cursor and Windsurfer
3. Update to reflect the use of Agentic IDE that use rules to create precise simulations with consistent UIs.  Give a precise example of how new MicroSims now follow responsive design patterns so that window resize events change relevant user interface elements.
4. Update text to reflect the ability of newer agentic frameworks to use LLMs to manage the context window (MemGPT and Letta open source framework)
5. Update content to reflect the new ability to generate complex charts with interactive infographic hovers and click-through drills for regions of the infographic
6. Include course creation workflow infographic
7. Include a section on the ability to create high-quality graphic-novel story generation
8. Include a revised lists of prompts to bring out the best in LLMs
9. Include a new discussion of new strategies to use rules to generate better circuit layouts
10. Include the development of better JavaScript libraries to do draw circuits
11. Include a case study of how students in a senior design class were all able to generate intelligent textbooks in a 12-week semester.
