# Signal Processing with AI

![](./img/cover-social-media.png)

Welcome to our website on using generative AI to create
and maintain a Signal Processing online course.  This site
is designed to be forked so you can quickly customize it for
your own signal processing course.  It provides detailed tutorials 
on how to use generative AI to create and maintain your content.

[Table of Contents](./chapters/index.md)

This is a new innovative course on how to use
generative AI to create and maintain fun
signal processing content that leverages the latest generative AI
technologies to create a fun and engaging content for a wide
audience of students with various math backgrounds.

## Change Log

When we first created the outline for this course in October of 2024 the generative AI tools were in their infancy.  We now have much more
robust tools such as [Cursor](./glossary.md#cursor-ide) and [WindSurf] to create and modify the content of these online textbooks.
